# ShapeAnalyzer
A small program that demonstrates some basic trig within C++ and the CLR

This was the first time I look at the CLR and managed objects with C++, so bear with me if I have made a couple of mistakes. Feel free to add an issue to the tracker with any feedback you want me to read over.

# Brief
Created using the following project brief:

1. Rectangle overlap  
Write a small C++ program to test whether two rectangles overlap.

2. Line intersection  
Given two line segments, implement a C++ program to check whether the two line
segments intersect.

3. Point orientation  
For three points p1, p2 and p3 write a small C++ program to find the orientation of
the points e.g. clockwise.

4. 5-pointed star  
Write a C++ program to calculate the coordinates of a regular 5-pointed star
(pentagram).

5. Arrow on line  
Write a C++ program to draw an arrow in the middle of a straight line. The size of the
arrow should be adjustable.
